Due to the output from my tests I see that addBack actually adds to the
front of the list.
When I call removeBack and removeFront it appears to not do anything cause
all values that are added remain added and there are no values missing.
So, I'd have to say they ultimately do nothing to the list unless they check
if the list is empty or some other component of the list. They don't do what
is expected though.
